// Each item in the user's timeline is represented as a TimelineItem JSON
// structure, described below.

@interface GTLMirrorTimelineItem : GTLObject

// A list of media attachments associated with this item.
@property (retain) NSArray *attachments;  // of GTLMirrorAttachment

// The bundle ID for this item. Services can specify a bundleId to group many
// items together. They appear under a single top-level item on the device.
@property (copy) NSString *bundleId;

// A canonical URL pointing to the canonical/high quality version of the data
// represented by the timeline item.
@property (copy) NSString *canonicalUrl;

// The time at which this item was created, formatted according to RFC 3339.
@property (retain) GTLDateTime *created;

// The user or group that created this item.
@property (retain) GTLMirrorContact *creator;

// The time that should be displayed when this item is viewed in the timeline,
// formatted according to RFC 3339. This user's timeline is sorted
// chronologically on display time, so this will also determine where the item
// is displayed in the timeline. If not set by the service, the display time
// defaults to the updated time.
@property (retain) GTLDateTime *displayTime;

// ETag for this item.
@property (copy) NSString *ETag;

// HTML content for this item. If both text and html are provided for an item,
// the html will be rendered in the timeline.
@property (copy) NSString *html;

// Additional pages of HTML content associated with this item. If this field is
// specified, the item will be displayed as a bundle, with the html field as the
// cover. It is an error to specify this field without specifying the html
// field.
@property (retain) NSArray *htmlPages;  // of NSString

// The ID of the timeline item. This is unique within a user's timeline.
// identifier property maps to 'id' in JSON (to avoid Objective C's 'id').
@property (copy) NSString *identifier;

// If this item was generated as a reply to another item, this field will be set
// to the ID of the item being replied to. This can be used to attach a reply to
// the appropriate conversation or post.
@property (copy) NSString *inReplyTo;

// Whether this item is a bundle cover.
// If an item is marked as a bundle cover, it will be the entry point to the
// bundle of items that have the same bundleId as that item. It will be shown
// only on the main timeline â€” not within the opened bundle.
// On the main timeline, items that are shown are:
// - Items that have isBundleCover set to true
// - Items that do not have a bundleId In a bundle sub-timeline, items that are
// shown are:
// - Items that have the bundleId in question AND isBundleCover set to false
@property (retain) NSNumber *isBundleCover;  // boolValue

// When true, indicates this item is deleted, and only the ID property is set.
@property (retain) NSNumber *isDeleted;  // boolValue

// When true, indicates this item is pinned, which means it's grouped alongside
// "active" items like navigation and hangouts, on the opposite side of the home
// screen from historical (non-pinned) timeline items.
@property (retain) NSNumber *isPinned;  // boolValue

// The type of resource. This is always mirror#timelineItem.
@property (copy) NSString *kind;

// The geographic location associated with this item.
@property (retain) GTLMirrorLocation *location;

// A list of menu items that will be presented to the user when this item is
// selected in the timeline.
@property (retain) NSArray *menuItems;  // of GTLMirrorMenuItem

// Controls how notifications for this item are presented on the device. If this
// is missing, no notification will be generated.
@property (retain) GTLMirrorNotificationConfig *notification;

// For pinned items, this determines the order in which the item is displayed in
// the timeline, with a higher score appearing closer to the clock. Note:
// setting this field is currently not supported.
@property (retain) NSNumber *pinScore;  // intValue

// A list of users or groups that this item has been shared with.
@property (retain) NSArray *recipients;  // of GTLMirrorContact

// A URL that can be used to retrieve this item.
@property (copy) NSString *selfLink;

// Opaque string you can use to map a timeline item to data in your own service.
@property (copy) NSString *sourceItemId;

// The speakable version of the content of this item. Along with the READ_ALOUD
// menu item, use this field to provide text that would be clearer when read
// aloud, or to provide extended information to what is displayed visually on
// Glass.
@property (copy) NSString *speakableText;

// Text content of this item.
@property (copy) NSString *text;

// The title of this item.
@property (copy) NSString *title;

// The time at which this item was last modified, formatted according to RFC
// 3339.
